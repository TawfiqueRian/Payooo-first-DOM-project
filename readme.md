**Q3: What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?**  
Ans:  
    Event bubbling means the event starts at the target element and moves upward in the DOM tree through the parent nodes.  
    It first runs the target element, then moves up to its parent, then to the parent's parent and so on, until it reaches the document.

**Q4: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?**  
Ans:  
    Event Delegation in JavaScript means using one parents's event listener to manage all its children's events via bubbling.  
    It is useful because it helps a developer by using fewer event listeners that ensures better memory and speed, by dynamic elements and also overall cleaner code.
